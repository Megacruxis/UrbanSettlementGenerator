# Current planning :

* Biome adaptability step 1 (being able to determine the biome) -> begin : 21/04/2020 and end : 27/04/2020
* Skyscrapers upgrade (make the building prettier and add more variety in the generation) -> begin : 27/04/2020 and end : 04/05/2020 
* Biome adaptability step 2 (building have variation with biome, for exemple greenhouse have yellow glass in desert) -> begin : 05/05/2020 and end : 12/05/2020
+ Adding new buildings to improve variety and to prepare the next step. For example I am going to add a well (when the city is generated in the desert), a grocery store and offices -> begin : 12/05/2020
* Clean the tree properly during generation -> begin : 17/05/2020 and end 02/06/2020
- Biome adaptability step 3 (some building spawn depending on the biome)
- Biome adaptability step 4 (the population of the city is calculated using the biome and population influence the generation of the city)
- Extra stuff depending on how I am doing (such as multiple biome detection)
